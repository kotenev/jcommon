-import scopes
? '=' instead of ':'?
? '{}' instead of '()'?
-serialize 'short' data in one line (either one  step of hierarchy, or just little data)
?support complex keys?

-optimize not earlier then requested
?don't use quotes in serializer if string is without spaces or parentheses?
-compare with gson (gson cannot do many things in contrast because of json constraints)

-code-generate optimized (de)serializer for custom classes


-write about using YADS instead of XML/YAML/JSON
-write about using YADS as syntax and AST back-end for custom language (which is better then simple lisp-like syntaxes)
-write about using YADS instead of .properties (multi-lines, comments, serialization, functions, etc...)

? why do we need escape \t also?

TODO

? in 'a = b' - use 'constructor(b)' if available for type? Also 'a = b, c' is 'constructor(a, b)'

-symbols like +-*/, etc - are valid identifiers
-parser generates simple lists only, not maps or YASClasses
-map {key=value} and YASClass is just one of many possible post-processings

-import scopes
-serialize 'short' data in one line (either one  step of hierarchy, or just little data)
?don't use quotes in serializer if string is without spaces or parentheses?
?support complex keys?

-code-generate optimized (de)serializer for custom classes

? why do we need escape \t also?
-optimize not earlier then requested

-javacc-less simple parser (to simplify creation for other languages)

?unary minus is regexp of number or grammar rule? Consider method calls and other operators

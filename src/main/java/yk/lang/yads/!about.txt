-add imports when custom serializer
-add default semantics for generating constructor
-define line width for short lines (so I can consider text input width when generating configs)
-serializer - don't generate import for field types (if field type == value type) (deserializer doesn't needs it)
-Range{0} - doesn't work if not imported (though its don't needs to because of field type)
sort map and set while serializing

//TODO

move 'class name' to serialization level
  leave parser level with just curly braces
-line numbers in errors
-namespaces in serialization

-serialize Set

YadsSerializer.serializeInner( some string ) causes stack overflow
prop = new SomeClass(){{ }} not serializing
add clone(), test it
YadsSerializer.deserializeClass((Class)t.getClass(), YadsSerializer.serialize(t))
  t is integer
infer type from constructor types (if called as constructor)

-serialize properties + constructor for YadsAware
-javaccless simple parser (to simplify creation for other languages)
  -or just use ANTLR to generate parser for different platforms
  -try to implement YadsSerializer with ANTLR

-reflector can't find constructor when casting is needed (int->float for ex.)
serialize without {} when needed
? forbid range={2} and range={1,2} ? (to force range=2 and range=1,2)
  ? or look at line-width or complexity to switch {} on and off?
  ? or forbid commas, because "a, b" is very not same as "a"
-serialize package OR package.class (when needed)

-symbols like +-*/, etc - must be valid identifiers
-parser generates simple lists only, not maps or YASClasses (REMOVE, conflicts with 'line numbers')
-map {key=value} and YadsClass is just one of many possible post-processings
?support complex keys?

?unary minus is regexp of number or grammar rule? Consider method calls and other operators
? why do we need escape \t also?
-optimize not earlier then requested
-code-generate optimized (de)serializer for custom classes

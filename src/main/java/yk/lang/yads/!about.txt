TODO
-define line width for short lines (so I can consider text input width when generating configs)
-serialize Set
-serialize properties + constructor for YadsAware
-YadsAware must not be forced serialize to List only

-Range{0} - doesn't work if not imported (though its don't needs to because of field type)
-serializer - don't generate import for field types (if field type == value type)
-line numbers in errors
-reflector can't find constructor when casting is needed (int->float for ex.)
-namespaces in serialization
serialize without {} when needed
? forbid range={2} and range={1,2} ? (to force range=2 and range=1,2)

-symbols like +-*/, etc - are valid identifiers
-parser generates simple lists only, not maps or YASClasses
-map {key=value} and YadsClass is just one of many possible post-processings

?don't use quotes in serializer if string is without spaces or parentheses?
?support complex keys?

-code-generate optimized (de)serializer for custom classes

? why do we need escape \t also?
-optimize not earlier then requested

-javaccless simple parser (to simplify creation for other languages)

?unary minus is regexp of number or grammar rule? Consider method calls and other operators

-serialize package OR package.class (when needed)

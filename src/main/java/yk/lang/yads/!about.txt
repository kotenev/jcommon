TODO


-symbols like +-*/, etc - are valid identifiers
-parser generates simple lists only, not maps or YASClasses
-map {key=value} and YASClass is just one of many possible post-processings

-import scopes
-serialize 'short' data in one line (either one  step of hierarchy, or just little data)
?don't use quotes in serializer if string is without spaces or parentheses?
?support complex keys?

-code-generate optimized (de)serializer for custom classes

-compare with gson (gson cannot do many things in contrast because of json constraints)
-write about using YADS instead of XML/YAML/JSON
-write about using YADS as syntax and AST back-end for custom language (which is better then simple lisp-like syntaxes)
-write about using YADS instead of .properties (multi-lines, comments, serialization, functions, etc...)

? why do we need escape \t also?
-optimize not earlier then requested
